      story: "We visited Picnic Point with our extended family of 15 people for a hurda party and it exceeded all expectations. The authentic preparation of hurda over wood fire, the scenic outdoor setting, and the warm hospitality made it unforgettable. Our kids loved the play area while we adults enjoyed the traditional Maharashtrian feast. The quality of hurda was exceptional - fresh, perfectly roasted with that amazing smoky flavor. We'll definitely return next season!",

      story: "We organized our annual team outing at Picnic Point and chose their hurda party package. The team-building activities were well-coordinated, the venue was spacious enough for our group of 40, and the hurda experience was a hit with everyone. Many of our team members from outside Maharashtra got to try hurda for the first time and loved it. The event coordinator was professional and ensured everything ran smoothly. Highly recommended for corporate gatherings!",

      story: "As someone who grew up in Mumbai, I'd heard about hurda parties but never experienced one. Picnic Point gave us the perfect authentic rural Maharashtra experience. The fresh hurda served with butter, jaggery, and green chili chutney was delicious. What impressed me most was how they've preserved the traditional method while providing clean, modern facilities. The staff explained the cultural significance of hurda season, making it educational too. A must-visit during winter!",
